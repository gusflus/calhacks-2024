# Helping people recover from strokes and other brain injuries

## Inspiration

We were inspired by the story of our founders grandfather. He had a stroke several years ago. He was able to make what seemed like a recovery, but over time since then his physical ability and his mental ability has degraded quickly. We wanted to help people who face a potentially similar situation an alternate, more positive outcome.

## How it works

Phoenix Health integrates with the patient's existing medical record and MRI and CT scans. The patient and doctor then both allow our service to analyze the most recent MRI and or CT scan and compare it to healthy pre-stroke scans. Our service then works with both the doctor and patient and facilitates the creation of a personalized, sustainable, and effective recovery strategy. We then work with the patient to contiue to monitor and customize the recovery and strategy as needed.
