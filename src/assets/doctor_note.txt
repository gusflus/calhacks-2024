I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide you with a tailored exercise plan focusing on speech, cognitive, and balance exercises to support your recovery process.

For speech exercises, start with simple phrases and tongue exercises daily for 10-15 minutes over the first four weeks to help improve your articulation and clarity. As you progress into the next phase (weeks 5-8), shift to practicing more complex sentences and pronunciation exercises 4-5 times a week, extending each session to 15-20 minutes to enhance your fluency. From week 9 onward, focus on more advanced tasks such as engaging in conversation practice and reading out loud for 20-30 minutes, 3-4 times a week, to further refine your communication skills.

Regarding cognitive exercises, during the first month, engage in activities like memory games and simple puzzles for 15-20 minutes each day to help sharpen your cognitive functions. Moving into the intermediate phase, from weeks 5 to 8, incorporate more challenging tasks such as advanced puzzles and memory recall exercises for 20-30 minutes, 4-5 times a week, to build on your progress. Beyond the eighth week, I recommend you partake in strategic games, problem-solving tasks, and possibly some group discussions or book reading sessions for 30-45 minutes, 3-4 times a week, to further stimulate your brain and maintain cognitive health.

For balance exercises, initially (weeks 1-4), focus on simple balance activities such as standing on one foot or walking heel-to-toe for 5-10 minutes daily to improve your stability. As you advance to the intermediate stage (weeks 5-8), try more dynamic activities such as gentle balance challenges and practice standing on unstable surfaces for 10-15 minutes, 3-4 times a week. From week 9 onwards, you can incorporate more complex tasks like balance exercises that involve coordination, such as reaching for objects while standing or using balance boards, for 15-20 minutes, 2-3 times a week.

Please follow these guidelines and let me know how you're progressing. Regular check-ins will help us adjust the plan as needed to ensure optimal recovery. Feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.
